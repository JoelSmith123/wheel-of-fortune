# wheel-of-fortune

Wheel of Fortune is a game that accepts 3 players and rewards players for guessing correctly the hidden letters in a puzzle.
Rewards are selected with a wheelspin, and the puzzle is displayed with each word as a blank. As each letter is guessed 
correctly, its location is filled in on the board. When all the letters are guessed, a new round begins with a new puzzle.
